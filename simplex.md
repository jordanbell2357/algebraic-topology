# Simplices

A **simplicial complex** $K$ is a finite nonempty set $V$ and a set $S$ of nonempty subsets of $V$ satisfying
- for each $v$ in $V$, the singleton $\{v\}$ belongs to $S$
- if $\sigma \in S$ and $\tau \subset \sigma$, then $\tau \in S$.

Elements of $V$ are called **vertices** and elements of $S$ are called **simplices**.

The **dimension** of a simplex is $\dim \sigma = |\sigma| - 1$.
